# -Gaussian-Processes-Model-

The Gaussian processes model is a probabilistic supervised machine learning framework that has been widely used for regression and classification tasks. A Gaussian processes regression (GPR) model can make predictions incorporating prior knowledge (kernels) and provide uncertainty measures over predictions. Gaussian processes model is a supervised learning method developed by computer science and statistics communities. Researchers with engineering backgrounds often find it is difficult to gain a clear understanding of it. To understand GPR, even only the basics needs to have knowledge of multivariate normal distribution, kernels, non-parametric model, and joint and conditional probability.
